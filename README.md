# credit-risk-classification

An overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the loan risk given to borrowers. 0 representing healthy loans, while 1 represents high risk loans. My job is to apply a model to predict how precise and accurate the loan status are so I can help the company decide on whether to lend money to individuals or deny them.

The results: 
accuracy score: 99%
precision score: 0 (healthy loans) 100%, 1 (high-risk loans) 84%
recall score: 0 (healthy loans) 99%, 1 (high-risk loans) 94%

A summary: 
My model predicted a 99% overall accuracy of correctly classified loans. I would definetly recommend this model to the company because my algorithm would help them make a decision of lending money to individuals or not.
